# A Simple Text Editor
This is a simple text editor I wrote to relearn C. Thanks to [this amazing guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo). 
I have made some changes like implementing Vim like Keybindings, a different way of saving files etc. 
Learnt a lot of stuff along the way.
I'll continue through the guide to add a searh feature and syntax highlighting.
